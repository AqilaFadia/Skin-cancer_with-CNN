# Predict Skin Cancer Malignant and Benign

# Overview
This project or research deals with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in relation to skin cancer. CNNs are a type of artificial neural network that is often used in image processing and visual pattern recognition. In this context, the project may aim to develop CNN models that can be used to detect, classify, or even predict types of skin cancer, including malignant and benign. The application of CNNs in this domain could have great potential to improve the accuracy of skin cancer diagnosis and patient care.

# Data Understanding
This dataset is a balanced dataset containing images of both benign and malignant cutaneous melanomas. The dataset is structured in two folders containing 1800 images each with a resolution of 224x244 pixels for both types of melanoma. The presence of this dataset has important value in supporting research and development in the field of medicine and computer science, especially in medical image recognition and diagnosis of skin diseases.
